							<h2>Overview</h2>
							<p>For a project in MProduct, Michigan's Product Management Club, me and my team designed an app that alerts students for on-campus and off-campus deals and discounts. </p>
							<h2>The Problem</h2>
							<p>The University of Michigan has free giveaways and deals nearly everyday that would greatly benefit college students, but many students are not aware of these deals since they are not advertised in a streamlined way.</p>
							<h2>The Solution</h2>
							<p>A2 Deals allows users to personalize what deals they are looking for (on campus vs. off campus, etc.) and notifies users of daily deals that might interest them. </p>
							<h2>Tools and Skills</h2>
							<p>Figma | UI/UX Design, User Research, Empathy Mapping, Personas, Wireframing, Prototyping, Usability Testing</p>
							<h2>Customer Discovery</h2>
							<p>We interviewed students by sending surveys about their experience with giveaways and deals at the University. We asked questions like "Do you read university emails about giveaways and why/why not? If yes, from what newsletters do you receive this information from? 
								How often do you get free products and discounted items?". We found that the majority of responses said they don't read university emails because they're too long or don't see it in a clutted inbox, which is where our app will come in. We also found that students get free deals around 2 times a semester.
							</p> 
							<h2>Design Principles</h2>
							<p>(1) Minimalistic design - easy to read, (2) navigation bars in order to filter our options, (3) onboarding - list of questions to customize user experience 
							</p>
							<h2>Next Steps</h2>
							<p>In the future, I would want to make a working "Saved" and "Profile" page to have a fully working prototype. I would also want to improve the "Search" page by adding more filters such as the ability to filter by building or discounted price. </p>
